# ðŸš€ Containerized Typescript React Application

This is a dockerized frontend application using React and the following technologies:

- Apollo GraphQL for data fetching
- React Router for routing
- Google Analytics for usage tracking and metrics
- Jest for Testing
- React Bootstrap
- Node-Sass for SCSS

It's built to use a GraphQL backend, like [this](https://github.com/KingOfCramers/typeorm-typegrapqhl-api) one.

## Development

1. Define any additional development variables inside a `.env.development` file. By default, the `.env.development` file doesn't require any variables, but it must exist.
2. You can start up the server with the `./dock dev start` by using the supplied bash script. Alternatively, run the `docker-compose` command by hand: `PORT=3000 docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` which will run your application locally, and expose it on `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing

1. Define any additional variables inside a `.env.test` file. By default, the `.env.test` file doesn't require any variables, but it must exist.
2. Run tests with the `./dock test start` command, or run the `docker-compose` command by hand: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm react_test`

## Production

In production, this application can be served standalone or via Kubernetes.

To serve it standalone, simply run: `docker run -d -p 80:80 kingofcramers/ts-react` or whatever you elect to name your docker image.

In kubernetes, the configuration files are stored inside the `infrastructure` folder. There is a separate readme for configuring your cluster contained in that folder.

## Installing NPM Packages (development)

1. Install in the running container `docker exec typeorm-api npm install PACKAGE_NAMES`
2. Install the packages locally with `npm install` (no need to specify the packages, because they will get picked up in your package.json file)

Note that you will have to `exec` install in your test container for the packages to be used there as well.

## Logs

Use the `./dock dev logs` command to follow the logs in development (they'll be hidden if you start your development server with the `--detached` flag).
